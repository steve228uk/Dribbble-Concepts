# Dribbble Concepts

[Dribbble](http://dribbble.com) is full of amazing concepts by extremely talented designers. This repo is a collection of some of those concepts that I've taken and built in Swift to experiement and learn things I've never done or built before.

## Concepts

- **Gradient Text** - Based on (Cassius Kiani's Concept)[https://dribbble.com/shots/3242185-Looking-for-a-Party]. This is an animated gradient masked with a UILabel to provide a fun effect.
